This folder contain the codes and data created during IDEATHON'22 for admission and jobs prediction based on demographic location. Hackathon is organised by AMITY University.

Our problem statement: Prediction of admission & jobs in engineering & technology / management / pharmacy with respect to demographic locations.

For demonstration purpose, we chose some target areas and used limited number of parameters. We did case study of those areas and got the expected outputs. These results can later be generalised to a very large area, even to the scale of countries, provided we get the required data. The data used in the creating this project is synthetic which was made after a complete experimentation and research of the area. The credibility of data lies in the fact that all the values and parameters chosen are taken from valid sources which includes annual report of colleges and companies, cagr of companies etc. The working of this project depends upon the quality and availibility of data.

A neural network model is used for the prediction of admission and jobs. LSTM: 4 layers with varying number of neurons GRU: 4 layers with varying number of neurons LINEAR REGRESSION: for admission

The predictions we made are shown in the form of graphs. Due to inavailibility of data, the graphs are the static based on predictions from previous data.
